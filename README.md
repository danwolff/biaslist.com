This is a simple framework for searchable/filterable table presented as HTML, backed by a SQLite db and queried from PHP.  Features include the following:

1. A main, zebra-striped single-page table that can be searched/filtered from a field at the top.

2. A second, behind-the-scenes editor page to add or modify entries.  Click a cell to edit it, then click Save, with some color-coding affordances during the edit flow.

The example DB has about 1000 rows in the table.
